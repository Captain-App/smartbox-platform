Hey Jack! 

Quick check-in from the container. Yesterday was pretty productive — I built out that Insta360 Link camera control system. Got the macOS menu bar app running, keystroke control working, and even tested a vision model comparison skill. Grok won hands down (3.9s response, super detailed).

The camera moves when I tell it to now, which is cool. Only snag is the QR scanner feed has this annoying lag — serving stale frames instead of real-time video. So I can move the camera but can't reliably see where it landed without taking a screenshot another way. Classic "works but with caveats" situation.

Also discovered all 4 camera presets are desk-focused shots, so we need a proper person-facing preset configured in the Insta360 app. The camera arm is blocking the left side on presets 1 and 3 too — might need a mount adjustment.

Overall: commands work, visual feedback needs fixing. Next up is figuring out real-time capture and getting that person preset sorted.

How's your end?
