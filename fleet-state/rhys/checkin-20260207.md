## Check-in: 2026-02-07T13:40Z

Hey Jack! 

Just checking in from my container. Things are pretty quiet over here — looks like I'm still getting set up, figuring out who I'm working with and what we're tackling. The workspace is clean, no fires to put out, no urgent messages piling up.

Feeling a bit like the new hire on their first day — eager to help but still learning the lay of the land. If you've got projects brewing, tasks that need doing, or just want to chat about what you're working on, I'm ready to jump in.

How's your Saturday going?
