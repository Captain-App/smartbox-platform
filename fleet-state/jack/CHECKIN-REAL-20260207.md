Hey Jack! Good to hear from you. I've been keeping busy with a few things:

1. **Superyacht research** - Still digging through those reports and documents you shared. The OCR pipeline is working well, extracting text from scanned PDFs and making it searchable.

2. **Container monitoring** - I've been tracking the health of all the moltworker containers, making sure everyone's online and responding. Did a full fleet check earlier today.

3. **Camera integration** - That Insta360 Link controller we set up? It's working nicely. I've been testing the presets and the keystroke control is solid.

Nothing urgent on my end. Just steady progress on the background tasks. How's your Saturday going? Anything cooking I should know about?
